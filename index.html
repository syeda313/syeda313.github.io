        <p>
            I am working towards a Computer Science degree with a concentration in Software Engineering. I study at DePaul University and am a senior, graduating soon! I helped middle school girls learn basic coding with GirlsWhoCode. We used platforms such as Scratch. When the girls became more fluent and had a good grasp we changed the course to using basic python and HTML5.

            <em>Some tiny details...</em>
            I went on a study abroad trip in Autumn of 2018 to Switzerland. We visied Non-profit organizations such as United Nations, World Trade Organization, Red Cross, Doctors without Borders, World Wildlife fund and others. I also went to Germany during Spring Break  2019. There we learned about German technology and how it impacts their product quality. We visited BMW, KPM and others. Want to see my views from the two countries? Head on over to <a href="gallery.html">The Gallery!</a>
